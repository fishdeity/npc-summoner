# npc-summoner

Summon any NPC (merchant, bank, broker) from anywhere.

### How to Use 
1. If you do not have this mod yet, download hdsn's files and put the folder into your Toolbox's mods folder: https://github.com/hsdn/npc-summoner
2. Download my config file and replace/put it into your Toolbox's mod's npc-summoner's folder with the rest of the files.
   - Make sure Toolbox is off before replacing/putting it in.
